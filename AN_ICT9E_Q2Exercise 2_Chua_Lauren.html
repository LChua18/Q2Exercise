			I would be complex<br>
			I would be cool<br>
			They'd say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to<br>
			And that would be ok<br>
			For me to do<br>
			Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you</p>
		<p>
			I'd be a fearless leader<br>
			I'd be an alpha type<br>
			When everyone believes ya<br>
			What's that like?</p>
		<p>
			I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
			Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br>
			If I was a man<br>
			And I'm so sick of them coming at me again<br>
			'Cause if I was a man<br>
			Then I'd be the man<br>
			I'd be the man<br>
			I'd be the man</p>
		<p>
			They'd say I hustled<br>
			Put in the work<br>
			They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve<br>
			What I was wearing<br>
			If I was rude<br>
			Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves?</p>
		<p>
			And they would toast to me, oh<br>
			Let the players play<br>
			I'd be just like Leo<br>
			In Saint-Tropez</p>
		<p>
			I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
			Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br>
			If I was a man<br>
			And I'm so sick of them coming at me again<br>
			'Cause if I was a man<br>
			Then I'd be the man<br>
			I'd be the man<br>
			I'd be the man</p>
		<p>
			What's it like to brag about<br>
			Raking in dollars<br>
			And getting <STRONG>-------</STRONG> and models<br>
			And it's all good if you're bad<br>
			And it's okay if you're mad<br>
			If I was out ﬂashing my dollars<br>
			I'd be a <STRONG>-----</STRONG>, not a baller<br>
			They paint me out to be bad<br>
			So it's okay that I'm mad</p>
		<p>
			I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
			Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (you know that)<br>
			And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)<br>
			'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man)<br>
			Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)<br>
			I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (as fast as I can)<br>
			Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (hey)<br>
			And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)<br>
			'Cause if I was a man (if I was a man), then I'd be the man</p>
		<p>
			I'd be the man<br>
			I'd be the man (oh)<br>
			I'd be the man (yeah)<br>
			I'd be the man (I'd be the man)<br>
			If I was a man<br>
			<span>Then I'd be the man<span></p>
